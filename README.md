### Setintel 1 - Prairie Pothole Time series extraction
78: [51.26, 49.77]
49: [52.17, 50.59]
34: [49.64]
151: [49.98]
107: [50.69] # 2017 -> 50.7, 2018 > remove 50.7
# Notes
- fpc_data_engineering: steps
    1. Find valid times series for each frame
    2. we will need to compute the intersect of the geometry of the frames, 17 - 21
    3. that is the region of interest
